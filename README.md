# Library Management System

## Overview

The **Library Management System** is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It allows users to manage books in a library, including adding, removing, searching, borrowing, and returning books. The system also stores book details and their status (available or borrowed).

## Features

- **Add a new book**: Users can add books by entering the title, author, and ISBN number.
- **Remove a book**: Books can be removed from the library using the ISBN number.
- **Search for a book by title**: Users can search for books in the library using the title of the book.
- **Borrow a book**: Users can borrow available books, which changes their status to "borrowed."
- **Return a book**: Users can return borrowed books, which changes their status back to "available."
- **List all books**: The system displays a list of all available books with their details.

## Technologies Used
